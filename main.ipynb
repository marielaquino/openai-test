This could include customer names, contact information, purchase history, preferences, or any other relevant details.', 'Split the data into messages: Divide the data into smaller units that can be processed by the model as individual messages. There are a few strategies you can employ:', \"Row-wise segmentation: Treat each row in the spreadsheet as a separate message. This can work well when each row represents a distinct entity or piece of information. For example, if each row represents a customer entry, you can segment the data such that each message contains the customer's details (name, contact information, etc.).\", 'Column-wise segmentation: Focus on specific columns and group related information together in a message. For instance, you can create messages that include all the purchase history data for a particular customer, combining the relevant columns such as purchase date, product name, and quantity.', 'Combined approach: Mix row-wise and column-wise segmentation as appropriate for your data. You can combine rows or columns based on the logical structure of the information you want to convey.', 'Structure messages using roles: Assemble each segmented unit into a message using role-based formatting. In a message, you typically have three roles: \"system\", \"user\", and \"assistant\". The \"user\" role represents the salesperson\\'s query or instruction, and the \"assistant\" role contains the generated response. You can use the \"system\" role to set context or provide instructions to the assistant.', 'System message: Set the initial context or provide instructions to the assistant. For example, you can start with a system message like: \"You are a sales assistant. Please provide information about customer ABC.\"\\nUser message: Pose a question or provide context about the customer data. For example: \"What is the purchase history for customer ABC?\"\\nAssistant message: Retrieve the response generated by the API.\\nCombine messages: Combine the system, user, and assistant messages into a list or sequence of messages that form a conversation. Each message should have a \"role\" and \"content\" field.', 'For example:', 'css\\nCopy code\\n[  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a sales assistant. Please provide information about customer ABC.\"},  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the purchase history for customer ABC?\"},  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}]\\nThe assistant\\'s response will be populated in the \"content\" field of the assistant message.', 'Iterate for multiple questions: Repeat the process for each question or query you want to ask about the Excel spreadsheet data. Create a new user message for each question and append it to the list of messages.', 'By tokenizing or segmenting the Excel spreadsheet data into messages with proper roles and content, you can effectively communicate the context and queries to the ChatGPT model for generating responses.']\n"
